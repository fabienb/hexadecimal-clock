## About

I wrote this fun 'hexadecimal clock' on CodePen in 2013. It simply displays the current time as a HEX colour code, filling the background with the relative colour. I believe it was inspired by a similar project, but I was unable to find it again after all these years.
These are the HTML, CSS and JS that made everything possible:

```html
<div id="hex-clock"></div>
```

```css
/*styling #hex-clock*/
/*custom font - Lato*/
@import url("[YOUR_FAVOURITE_FONT_URL_HERE]");
* {margin: 0; padding: 0; /*reset*/}
html, body {height: 100%; /*full-height*/}
#hex-clock {
	color: white; font: 36px/72px [FONT_REFERENCE_HERE]; height: 72px;
    /*centering*/
	position: relative; top: 50%; margin-top: -32px;
	text-align: center;
}
```

```javascript
var d, h, m, s, color;
function displayTime() {
	d = new Date();
	h = d.getHours();
	m = d.getMinutes();
	s = d.getSeconds();
	
	//add zero to the left of the numbers if they are single digits
	if(h <= 9) h = '0'+h;
	if(m <= 9) m = '0'+m;
	if(s <= 9) s = '0'+s;
	
	color = "#"+h+m+s;
	document.body.style.background = color;
	document.getElementById("hex-clock").innerHTML = color;
	
	//retrigger every second
	setTimeout(displayTime, 1000);
}

displayTime();
```

## Reprise

Late 2024, I wanted to convert this into a single PHP snippet to use in my WordPress blogs via a shortcode, probably something like `[hexclock]`, displaying this fun hexadecimal clock. 

The new version needed to:
- Get rid of the jQuery dependency in favour of pure Javascript
- Use `requestAnimationFrame` instead of `setTimeout`. This is generally preferred for animations because it is synchronised with the browserâ€™s repaint cycle. This leads to smoother visuals and better performance, especially when dealing with frequent updates like this clock.
- Apply the background change to the container `div` rather than the body

This is the updated version, currently displayed at the bottom of the home page on [koandesign.com](https://koandesign.com):

```php
<?php
/*

function hex_clock_shortcode() {
		$output = '<div id="hex-clock"></div>';

		$output .= '<style>
				#hex-clock {color:white;font:32px/72px unigeo64light,sans-serif;height:72px;position:relative;top:50%;text-align:center;}
		</style>';

		$output .= '<script>
				//lets display the current time
				var d, h, m, s, color;
				function displayTime() {
						d = new Date(); //new data object
						h = d.getHours();
						m = d.getMinutes();
						s = d.getSeconds();

						//add zero to the left of the numbers if they are single digits
						if(h <= 9) h = "0"+h;
						if(m <= 9) m = "0"+m;
						if(s <= 9) s = "0"+s;

						color = "#"+h+m+s;
						//set background color
						document.getElementById("hex-clock").style.background = color; // Changed to hex-clock div
						//set time
						document.getElementById("hex-clock").innerHTML = color;

						//retrigger the function every second
						//setTimeout(displayTime, 1000); // original
						requestAnimationFrame(displayTime); // Use requestAnimationFrame instead of setTimeout
				}

				//call the function
				displayTime();
		</script>';

		return $output;
}
add_shortcode( 'hexclock', 'hex_clock_shortcode' );
?>
```

Unigeo64 is the beautiful font created by [Zetafonts](https://www.zetafonts.com/unigeo) in use on koandesign.com, hence the `unigeo64light` reference above. 
You can always decouple the HTML, CSS and JS parts from this code, if you don't run WordPress and want to implement this elsewhere.
