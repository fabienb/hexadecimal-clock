## About

I wrote this fun 'hexadecimal clock' on CodePen in 2013. It simply displays the current time as a HEX colour code, filling the background with the relative RGB colour. For example, `16:07:24` becomes `#160724` (a very dark shade of blue-magenta, `rgb: 22, 7, 36`).

I believe it was inspired by a similar project, but I was unable to find it again after all these years.

These are the HTML, CSS and JS that made everything possible:

```html
<div id="hex-clock"></div>
```

```css
/*styling #hex-clock*/
/*custom font - Lato*/
@import url("[YOUR_FAVOURITE_FONT_URL_HERE]");
* {margin: 0; padding: 0; /*reset*/}
html, body {height: 100%; /*full-height*/}
#hex-clock {
	color: white; font: 36px/72px [FONT_REFERENCE_HERE]; height: 72px;
    /*centering*/
	position: relative; top: 50%; margin-top: -32px;
	text-align: center;
}
```

```javascript
var d, h, m, s, color;
function displayTime() {
	d = new Date();
	h = d.getHours();
	m = d.getMinutes();
	s = d.getSeconds();
	
	//add zero to the left of the numbers if they are single digits
	if(h <= 9) h = '0'+h;
	if(m <= 9) m = '0'+m;
	if(s <= 9) s = '0'+s;
	
	color = "#"+h+m+s;
	document.body.style.background = color;
	document.getElementById("hex-clock").innerHTML = color;
	
	//retrigger every second
	setTimeout(displayTime, 1000);
}

displayTime();
```

## Reprise

Late 2024, I wanted to convert this into a single PHP snippet to use in my WordPress blogs via a shortcode, probably something like `[hexclock]`, displaying this fun hexadecimal clock. 

The new version needed to:
- Get rid of the jQuery dependency in favour of pure Javascript
- Use `requestAnimationFrame` instead of `setTimeout`. This is generally preferred for animations because it is synchronised with the browserâ€™s repaint cycle. This leads to smoother visuals and better performance, especially when dealing with frequent updates like this clock.
- Apply the background change to the container `div` rather than the body

This is the updated version, currently displayed at the bottom of the home page on [koandesign.com](https://koandesign.com):

```php
<?php
/*
Snippet Name: Hexadecimal Clock
Snippet URI: https://koan.design
Description: Fun clock that displays the current time into as a HEX colour code with an ever-changing background. Creates a shortcode to include anywhere in WordPress.

function hex_clock_shortcode() {
	$output = '<div id="hex-clock"></div>';

	$output .= '<style>
		#hex-clock {color:white;font:32px/64px unigeo64light,sans-serif;height:64px;position:relative;top:50%;text-align:center;}
	</style>';

	$output .= '<script>
		//lets display the current time
		var d, h, m, s, color;
		function displayTime() {
			d = new Date(); //new data object
			h = d.getHours();
			m = d.getMinutes();
			s = d.getSeconds();

			//add zero to the left of the numbers if they are single digits
			if(h <= 9) h = "0"+h;
			if(m <= 9) m = "0"+m;
			if(s <= 9) s = "0"+s;

			color = "#"+h+m+s;
			//set background color
			document.getElementById("hex-clock").style.background = color; // Changed to hex-clock div
			//set time
			document.getElementById("hex-clock").innerHTML = color;

			//retrigger the function every second
			//setTimeout(displayTime, 1000); // original
			requestAnimationFrame(displayTime); // Use requestAnimationFrame instead of setTimeout
		}

		//call the function
		displayTime();
	</script>';

	return $output;
}
add_shortcode( 'hexclock', 'hex_clock_shortcode' );
?>
```

Unigeo64 is the beautiful font created by [Zetafonts](https://www.zetafonts.com/unigeo) in use on koandesign.com, hence the `unigeo64light` reference above. 

You can always decouple the HTML, CSS and JS parts from this code, if you don't run WordPress and want to implement this elsewhere.

## Installation

Copy the raw PHP code you find in `hexadecimal-clock.php` and add it to your WordPress. This can be done in 2 different ways: 
- editing the `functions.php` file in your theme, which I would never recommend unless you are using a child theme; 
- adding this code into a snippets manager plugin.

My favourite snippets manager is **Fluent Snippets**. I do not have any affiliation with Fluent, it's simply the plugin I use because it's free and does not bloat the database but keeps all snippets in separate external files (easier to manage, backup and transfer and also much better performance). 
Whatever your preference, this snippet works in whatever plugin you are using.

Of course, *always make a backup copy of your current WordPress before making any changes*.

## System Requirements

There are no particular requirements, but this has been tested in the following conditions:
- WordPress 5.8 and higher
- PHP 8.1 and higher
